# React Tutorial goals

The goal of this project is to make a something that mimics a shopping cart. It will have increment and decrement buttons. A dynamic counter that changes based on value where if its 0 it will change colour. 

So far I am as you can see with this code I am just at the stage with the dynamic counter.

To run this on your local machine you will need npm or yarn

npx create-react-app counter-app
cd counter-app
npm start

I will continue to update this branch until I am at the completed stage. It isn't commented right now. However i plan on completion to annotation everything in detail so it can be used as a learning exercise for my teammates alongside a tool if I need a refresher on anything.
