# Capstone Pace B

## Description

  Pace B's objective is to create a web application for companies looking to implement a mentorship program, and link mentors and mentees together. The target user groups include the organization(the admin), the mentors and the mentees. The purpose of linking mentors and mentees is to allow more senior employees to pass on their knowledge to newer employees.
  This web application provides the admin and its mentors with the ability to create and access their user accounts. The mentees can not create user accounts, as they sign up for mentorship through a form embedded on their desired companyâ€™s website, via an iframe. It will allow mentees to match with mentors using logical checks based on their preferred skills. When a mentor-mentee match is successful, the mentee is sent a confirmation email linking them to their mentor, and further interaction and mentorship occurs externally through email.

## User Groups and Registration

  An admin will interact with a form similar to the image below. The information given from the form will then be used to create the organization, as well as the admin user account. The admin account has the features of a mentor account. It also has added features including the ability to invite mentors to the organization via email, and the ability to embed the mentee form into an external website via an iframe.

  A mentor will interact with a form similar to the image below. A mentor can only signup using the form, with the email the admin addressed an invite to. The information given from the form will then be used to create the user's mentor account. The mentor has the feature to accept or reject mentees who have signed up for mentorship. Once a mentor accepts a mentee, a confirmation email is sent to the mentee who has just been accepted.

A mentee will interact with a form similar to the image below. The information given from the form will then be sent to the organization for the mentors to see. When a user signs up as a mentee, they are sent a confirmation email. They are also sent a confirmation email when a mentor accepts them for mentorship.
