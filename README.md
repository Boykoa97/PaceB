# PaceB

## Goals

The goal of PaceB is to make a system where an orginzation can link mentors and mentees. 

This can be accomplished two way:
1. A company can host the system internally  
2. the company can have the matching system embedded as an iframe on their website. This iframe would look similar to that if you have google maps embedded on your site.

## Matching System 

The matching system will show a mentee potenial mentors based on information such as the langauge they speak, areas of interest, and time zone availablity. For a full list of these criterion the file name where this is performed will be mentioned.

## Requirements 

We will be providing information on how to access our database and server space that will be used to host the system.

We will also add the Tech Stack information that we will using in the coming week.
