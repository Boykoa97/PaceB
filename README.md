# React Tutorial goals

The goal of this project is to make a something that mimics a shopping cart. It will have increment and decrement buttons. A dynamic counter that changes based on value where if its 0 it will change colour. 

So far I am as you can see with this code I am just at the stage with the dynamic counter.

To run this on your local machine you will need npm or yarn

npx create-react-app counter-app
cd counter-app
npm start

It taught me how components interact in react, how to create and adjust items in a react application, it also taught me some naming conventions alongside some how to create functions in javascript and how we should store and build our components for the front end for our project
